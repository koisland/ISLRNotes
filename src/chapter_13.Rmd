The code below describes chapter 13 of *An Introduction to statistical learning with applications in R*, *Multiple Testing*.

## 13.1: A Quick Review of Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing provides a rigorous statistical framework for answering "yes-or-no" questions about data.
* Ex. Is there a difference in the mean blood pressure of lab mic in the control vs. the treatment group?

### 13.1.1 Testing a Hypothesis
1. Define null and alternative hypotheses.
2. Construct a test statistic that summarizes the strength of evidence *against the null hypothesis*.
3. Compute a p-value that quantifies the probability of having obtained *a comparable or more extreme value of the test statistic under the null hypothesis.*
3. Based on the p-value, we decide to reject the null hypothesis.

#### Define the Null and Alternate Hypotheses
Two possibilities:

* Null ($H_o$)
  * The default state of belief about the world.
* Alternate ($H_a$)
  * Something different and unexpected
  * Suggests that the null hypothesis does not hold.

#### Construct the Test Statistic
A test statistic summaries the extent to which our data are consistent with $H_o$.

**Example: Mice Blood Pressure**

* $n_t$ treatment mice
* $n_c$ control mice
* $x$ denotes the blood pressure measurements.
  * Treatment: $x_1^t, ... x^t_{n_t}$
  * Control: $x_1^c, ... x^c_{n_c}$

Calculate a **two-sample t-statistic** to test $H_o$ where the average blood pressure of both groups are equivalent.

<center>
$T = \frac{\hat{\mu}_t - \hat{\mu}_c}{s \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_t} + \frac{1}{n_c}}}$
</center>

* $\hat{\mu}_t/\hat{\mu}_c$$ Are the averages of the blood pressure measurements for both groups.
* $s$ is an estimator of the pooled standarad deviation of the two sample groups.

**A large (absolute) value of $T$ provides evidence against the null hypothesis.**

#### Compute the p-value
Next we need to determine how much evidence against $H_o$ is provided by a large test statistic.

**A p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic equal to or more extreme than than the observed statistic under the assumption that the $H_o$ is true.**

  * A small p-value provides evidence against $H_o$.

**Example: $T = 2.33$**

* Under $H_o$, distribution follows $N(0,1)$ distribution.
  * A normal distribution with mean of 0 and variance of 1.
  * Majority (98%) of $T$ values fall between $-2.33$ and $2.33$.
  * Expect to see our result only 2% of the time.

Null distribution depends on:

* Type of $H_o$ being tested.
* Type of test statistic is used.

Most commonly-used test stats follow a well-known statistical distribution under $H_o$.

**Interpretation**

Often incorrectly interpreted. The CORRECT interpretation is:

> Given that the $H_o$ is true, the p-value is the chance we'd see this value of the test statistic or something more extreme if the test was repeated many times.

Converting the test statistic (An arbitrary and uninterpretable number) into a **p-value** (an easy-to-understand value between 0 and 1) **helps researchers interpret a result**.

* Additional context given by p-value as we now what should be expected under $H_o$ null distribution.

#### Decide Whether to Reject the Null Hypothesis
Typically, some arbitary threshold of $<0.05$.

Should never blindly adhere to a value. Also, include p-value in reporting.
